Thought for a few seconds


**Slide 1: “Neoliberal Power and Greek Austerity”**
This opening slide sets the stage by explaining how the IMF, World Bank and the Troika enforced privatization, deregulation and strict austerity measures in post‑2008 Greece. Begin with a concise headline—“Troika’s Prescription: Austerity Over Growth”—followed by three tightly worded bullets:

* **Structural Adjustment Explained:** Define “conditional loans” and their core components (privatization, deregulation, spending cuts).
* **Deepening the Crisis:** Show how bailout funds looped back to European banks while Greek unemployment and poverty soared.
* **Elite Profit, Public Pain:** Emphasize that debt‑service payments flowed out of the public coffers to global financial institutions.

On the right half of the slide, include a simple flowchart tracing “Loan → Conditions → Spending Cuts → Debt Trap,” with minimalist icons (bank building, downward arrow, broken piggy‑bank). Below it, place a stark photograph of shuttered Greek storefronts or an empty factory floor to drive home the human cost. In speaker notes, briefly define key terms (“Troika,” “structural adjustment”) so you can elaborate without cluttering the slide.

**Slide 2: “Global Crisis and the Rise of Resistance”**
The second slide zooms out to reveal this same model at work worldwide—and how citizens have responded. Lead with the heading “From Athens to Argentina: A Pattern of Protest,” then present these narrative bullets:

* **Repeated Across Continents:** Illustrate how Latin America, Southeast Asia and sub‑Saharan Africa endured similar loan‑conditional cycles.
* **Media, Fear and Force:** Describe the elite toolkit for quelling dissent—state violence, disinformation campaigns, and emergency laws.
* **Hope and New Strategies:** Highlight how social movements adapt, from Occupy‑style encampments to digital solidarity networks.

Visually, use a world map dotted with icons marking major debt‑crisis hotspots. Beside the map, include a collage of protest imagery—marching crowds, placards, and community assemblies. Add a small callout box with a 2‑minute QR‑linked video of Greek demonstrations (optional). In your notes, pose three open‑ended questions—e.g., “What alternatives to austerity have grassroots groups proposed?”—to spur post‑presentation discussion.
